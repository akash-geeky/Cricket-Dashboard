End-to-End Cricket Analytics Project

A complete data analytics workflow — from web scraping to Power BI dashboards — built using real match data from the T20 World Cup 2022.

📌 Project Overview

This project showcases my end-to-end data analytics skills using cricket performance data.
I scraped player and match information from ESPN Cricinfo, cleaned and transformed the dataset using Python, and finally built an interactive Power BI dashboard to derive actionable insights.

🎯 Objective

Analyze performances of all players from the T20 World Cup 2022

Identify the Best Playing XI capable of:
✔️ Scoring 180+ runs consistently
✔️ Defending 150 runs effectively

Build a data-driven, role-balanced team using batting, bowling, and all-rounder metrics

🔔 Summary

Using fully scraped, structured data from ESPN Cricinfo, I built a complete analytics pipeline to:

Process match summaries, batting stats, bowling stats, and player info

Extract patterns and measure consistency, impact, strike rates, and economy

Categorize players into key T20 roles — Openers, Anchors, Finishers, All-rounders, and Fast Bowlers

Visualize insights through an interactive Power BI report

Formulate a 100% data-backed Best XI team combination
